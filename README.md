# Deepfake-Detection
Our project is centered around deepfake detection methods and how we compare the effectiveness of each one using different datasets. After testing, we will make a UI application that allows users to test out the FACTOR method that produced the most effective results. Detection methods used in this project include FACTOR, LipForensics, and Self-Supervised Video Forensics by Audio-Visual Anamoly Detection.
