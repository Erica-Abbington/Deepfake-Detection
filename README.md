# Deepfake-Detection
Our project is centered around deepfake detection methods and how we compare the effectiveness of each one using different datasets. After testing, we make a UI application that allows users to test out these methods. Detection methods used in this project inclue FACTOR, LipForensics, Self-Supervised Video Forensics by Audio-Visual Anamoly Detection.
